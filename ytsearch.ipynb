      "    \"description\": \"This video is about how to program your subconscious mind. In this video, you will be presented with a method you can use to program your subconscious mind. You will learn how to program your subconscious mind and the best time to do it. Wayne explains what happens when you focus on negative ideas such as past hurts, resentments and grievances and why you mustn't do this. \\n\\nYou will learn how what you are thinking about right before you go to sleep is absorbed in to your subconscious mind and why you must be deliberate about what you dwell upon right before falling asleep. You will learn where we originate from and what we are at out core. \\n\\nDyer also expresses that names such as the Tao, soul, God, spirit are all different expressions of the same thing we call the source of life. Although, in all actuality can never be fully known as the source of all life is limitless. Words can only serve as symbols, pointing to an idea of the source of all life.\\n\\nWayne talks about the the hidden meaning behind the 'book of Job', chapter 33, verse 15-16 as well as the real meaning of the famous book Moby Dick and how a mans search for a whale is really about a mans search for his higher self. https://amzn.to/3EInxyX \\n\\nThis video also includes some positive affirmations and statements that you can say to yourself instead of the negative thoughts you think about. Wayne also shares a deeply spiritual meditation taken from chapter 1 of a book called, 'Three Magic Words' by Uell S. Andersen, https://amzn.to/3u4JFyG which you can listen to or recite to yourself before you fall asleep or at any time that is most convenient to you. \\n\\nAfter this video, you will be presented with a question; in the words of Wayne Dyer, \\\"will you be a host to God, or a hostage to your ego? It's your call\\\".\\n\\nI have created a video to accompany this teaching with the meditation on repeat for over 1 hour with music and also 10 minutes without music, which you can select the loop option for longer if required.\\n\\nWayne Dyer - First Meditation from 'Three Magic Words' - before sleep meditation loop with relaxing music \\nhttps://youtu.be/44ImQV46lF4\\n\\nWayne Dyer - First Meditation from 'Three Magic Words' - 10 minute meditation loop - no music\\nhttps://youtu.be/rZ5OLTeMJDQ\\n\\n\\n\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\n\\nThe speaker in this video is the late Dr. Wayne Walter Dyer, 10th May, 1940 - 29th August 2015. Born in Detroit, Michigan in the United States; as a child, he grew up in orphanages and foster homes. Despite his humble beginnings, he would overcome many personal obstacles, and go on to become the greatest self-help guru and motivational speaker of our time. The author of 40 self-help books, of which 21 of those would make it to the New York bestsellers list. He has also created lots of content in audio and video format, as well as appeared on countless radio and tv shows. It goes without saying, he is world renowned for his contribution to the self-help and spiritual community. He is loved, respected and missed by so many people all over the world, whose lives he has impacted with his loving and empathic contribution through his life work. I think it's fair to say, that his spirit lives on with everything he left for us to enjoy and use for our own self development.\\n\\nIn making and editing this video, I intended to capture the essence of the spirit of the following teaching. The success of this video, i think is a good indicator that it did. The comments have been a joy to read, with many testifying to the benefits Wayne has provided to them through his teachings. Some have also testified to his genuine kindness and generosity in meeting him personally whilst going about their daily life.\\n\\nYou can find out more about the wonderful Wayne Dyer's legacy by visiting https://www.drwaynedyer.com \\n\\n\\n\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\n\\n\\nWhere can i watch more Wayne Dyer videos like this?\\n\\nI have created other Wayne dyer videos in my own editing style of which I have linked below:\\n\\nWayne Dyer - Success is an inner process\\nhttps://youtu.be/txApdGp3yKA\\n\\nWayne Dyer - What if it doesn't work?\\nhttps://youtu.be/jUVlEItdNAg\\n\\nWayne Dyer - Ambition - Aspects of the ego\\nhttps://youtu.be/X_LhVOCscYo\\n\\nWayne Dyer - Give up your personal history - with music\\nhttps://youtu.be/FwD8xBo4I3Y\\n\\nWayne Dyer - Give up your personal history - no music\\nhttps://youtu.be/3gXFvpzboZU\\n\\n\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\u2764\\n\\nNeville Goddard - States Of Consciousness \\nhttps://youtu.be/QaZ7KYuJoIE?si=K4a-sTEvOOyb2HZJ\\n\\n\\ud83e\\udde1\\n\\nThank you to all who have contributed subtitles in other languages \\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\ude4f \\n\\nThank you so much \\u2764\\ufe0f\\n\\n\\ud83e\\udde1\\n\\nChannel Disclaimer: \\nThe videos provided are for informational and educational purposes and is not a substitute for professional services.

      "    \"description\": \"This recording might be one of the most powerful I\\u2019ve ever created. Why? Because it focuses on gratitude. Gratitude affirmations are statements that acknowledge the good things in your life, both big and small. By regularly repeating these affirmations, you can train your mind to focus on the positive, which can help to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Studies show that people who practice gratitude regularly have a more optimistic outlook on life, are more resilient in the face of adversity, and are generally happier and more satisfied with their lives. So, if you're looking for a simple yet powerful way to improve your overall well-being, add these 10 gratitude affirmations to your daily routine.

      "    \"description\": \"This recording might be one of the most powerful I\\u2019ve ever created. Why? Because it focuses on gratitude. Gratitude affirmations are statements that acknowledge the good things in your life, both big and small. By regularly repeating these affirmations, you can train your mind to focus on the positive, which can help to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Studies show that people who practice gratitude regularly have a more optimistic outlook on life, are more resilient in the face of adversity, and are generally happier and more satisfied with their lives. So, if you're looking for a simple yet powerful way to improve your overall well-being, add these 10 gratitude affirmations to your daily routine.
